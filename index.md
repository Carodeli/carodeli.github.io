## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 12

  This lab was my favorite because I learned how to create a flipbook animation using GIF files.  It reminded me of the time I programmed LED strips. In part-1, I learned how to code each channel color. It was interesting seeing how trig was used to code the animation. 

* Lab 8
  
  This lab was my second favorite. In this lab, I learned how to calculate the Olympic judge average of scores. This lab was interesting because we had to write a function that calculated the average score without the minimum and maximum values. My partner and I did run into a lot of syntax errors, so it was challenging. However, we were able to help each other identity misspelled words and missing semi-colons.

* Lab  9, part 1
  
  This lab was my third favorite. In part-1, I learned how to write a spell checker program using for-loop and if statements. I really enjoyed this lab because a spell checker is one of the most useful things.
